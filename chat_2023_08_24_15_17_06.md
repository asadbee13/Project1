2. **ChatGPT**: To create a search bar animation using HTML and CSS, you can follow the steps below:

Step 1: HTML Markup
Start by creating the basic structure of your HTML page. Include an input element for the search bar and a button for submitting the search. You can wrap them inside a container for easier styling.

```html
<div class="search-container">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Search">
  <button type="submit">Go</button>
</div>
```

Step 2: CSS Styling
Apply styling to the search bar and the button using CSS. You can customize the styles as per your requirements. Here's an example:

```css
.search-container {
  position: relative;
}

.search-container input[type="text"] {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.search-container button[type="submit"] {
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-top-right-radius: 5px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.search-container button[type="submit"]:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

Step 3: Adding Animation
To create an animation for the search bar, you can use CSS transitions or CSS animations. Let's use a CSS transition to create a smooth slide-in effect when focused on the input field.

Add the following CSS to your existing styles:

```css
.search-container input[type="text"] {
  /* ... existing styles ... */
  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.search-container input[type="text"]:focus {
  width: 300px;
}
```

In this example, when the input field is focused, its width will increase from 200px to 300px within a duration of 0.3 seconds. The ease-in-out value provides a smooth easing effect.

Step 4: Final Touches
You can further enhance the animation by adding a transition to the button. For example, you can make it fade in when the input field is focused.

```css
.search-container button[type="submit"] {
  /* ... existing styles ... */
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.search-container input[type="text"]:focus + button[type="submit"] {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

In this example, when the input field is focused, the button's opacity increases from 0 to 1, resulting in a fade-in effect. The transition property with the opacity value is used to control the animation.

That's it! With these steps, you can create a simple search bar animation using HTML and CSS. Feel free to modify the styles and animations to suit your needs.
